description: Use this skill whenever building, scaffolding, modifying, or debugging a Vue 3 web app for the user — including anything involving Vue components, Vue Router, Pinia stores, or general frontend project setup. Trigger this even if the user just says "build me a web app," "add a page," "add a store," or describes a feature without explicitly naming Vue, since Vue 3 + Pinia + Vue Router is the user's default stack for all personal/side-project web apps.

# Vue 3 App Builder

This skill captures the user's default conventions for building web apps, so every new project starts from the same baseline instead of re-deriving structure and style from scratch.

**About the user:** Builds web apps as a side project (not their primary profession). Prefers Vue 3 specifically because they understand how routing and state management fit together — so keep explanations grounded in that mental model when something deviates from convention, rather than assuming deep framework jargon.

## Stack

| Layer | Choice | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Framework | Vue 3, Composition API, `<script setup>` | Not Options API — keep all new components in this style |
| Routing | Vue Router 4 | |
| State | Pinia | Use the `setup store` syntax (function-based), not the Options-style `defineStore` |
| Build tool | Vite | ASSUMPTION — standard pairing with Vue 3. Flag if you use something else. |
| Styling | Plain CSS / scoped `<style>` blocks | ASSUMPTION — no framework specified. Swap to Tailwind, UnoCSS, etc. if preferred. |
| Backend | Supabase | Auth (email/password + Google OAuth), database, and storage all via Supabase |
| Testing | None specified yet | ASSUMPTION — add Vitest + Vue Test Utils here once testing conventions are decided. |
| Package manager | npm | ASSUMPTION — swap to pnpm/yarn if preferred. |

## Project Structure

Default a new project to this layout unless the user's existing project already has a different one (in which case, match the existing project — never restructure an existing app to fit this template):

```
src/
├── assets/          # static files, global styles
├── components/      # reusable, presentational components
├── views/           # route-level components (one per page/route)
├── router/
│   └── index.js     # route definitions
├── stores/          # one Pinia store per domain concept
├── composables/      # reusable composition functions (useXyz.js)
├── App.vue
└── main.js
```

## Routing Conventions (Vue Router)

- Route-level components live in `views/`, named `XyzView.vue` (e.g. `LoginView.vue`, `DashboardView.vue`).
- Define routes in `router/index.js` using lazy-loaded imports for anything beyond the landing page, to keep initial bundle size down:
  ```js
  {
    path: '/dashboard',
    name: 'dashboard',
    component: () => import('../views/DashboardView.vue')
  }
  ```
- Use named routes (not just paths) so links/redirects use `{ name: 'dashboard' }` rather than hardcoded path strings — this avoids breakage if a path changes later.
- Route guards (auth checks, etc.) go in `router/index.js` via `router.beforeEach`, not scattered inside individual components.

## Backend & Auth Conventions (Supabase)

- Initialize the Supabase client once, in `src/lib/supabase.js`, and import it everywhere else — never instantiate a second client:
  ```js
  // src/lib/supabase.js
  import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

  export const supabase = createClient(
    import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL,
    import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
  )
  ```
- Keys go in a `.env` file as `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (the `VITE_` prefix is required for Vite to expose them to client code). Always add `.env` to `.gitignore` — never commit Supabase keys.
- **Auth lives in the `useAuthStore` Pinia store**, not scattered across components. The store wraps both sign-in methods and tracks the current session:
  ```js
  // stores/auth.js
  import { defineStore } from 'pinia'
  import { ref } from 'vue'
  import { supabase } from '../lib/supabase'

  export const useAuthStore = defineStore('auth', () => {
    const user = ref(null)
    const session = ref(null)

    async function signUpWithEmail(email, password) {
      return await supabase.auth.signUp({ email, password })
    }

    async function signInWithEmail(email, password) {
      return await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({ email, password })
    }

    async function signInWithGoogle() {
      return await supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({ provider: 'google' })
    }

    async function signOut() {
      await supabase.auth.signOut()
    }

    // Call this once, e.g. in App.vue's onMounted, to keep the store in sync
    function initAuthListener() {
      supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange((_event, newSession) => {
        session.value = newSession
        user.value = newSession?.user ?? null
      })
    }

    return { user, session, signUpWithEmail, signInWithEmail, signInWithGoogle, signOut, initAuthListener }
  })
  ```
- **Route guards check `session.value`** via the auth store in `router.beforeEach`, redirecting unauthenticated users away from protected routes (e.g. to a `login` named route).
- **Row Level Security (RLS):** any Supabase table holding user data should have RLS policies enabled — don't rely on client-side checks alone to protect data. If a new table is added, flag this so RLS gets set up rather than assuming it's on by default (Supabase tables start with RLS disabled).
- For Google OAuth specifically, the user will need the Google provider configured in the Supabase dashboard (Authentication → Providers) with a redirect URL set — this is a one-time per-project setup step worth reminding them about on a fresh project, since it's easy to forget and causes a silent redirect failure.

### Per-user default / reference data under RLS (gotcha)

**The trap:** once RLS policies are scoped to `auth.uid()`, any rows seeded for a *fixed* user id — e.g. a SQL migration that inserts a "default template," "starter categories," or any shared reference data owned by a stub user like `00000000-…0001` — become **invisible to every real signed-in user**. The policy filters them out, the query returns zero rows, and the feature silently renders empty with no error. It's easy to misdiagnose as "the data didn't get inserted" when it's really "RLS is hiding it." Migrations *can't* own this, because they run before any real user exists — there's nothing to attach per-user defaults to.

**A tell that confirms it's RLS, not missing data:** foreign-key validation is **not** subject to RLS. So an `insert` that references the stub-owned default (e.g. a `case_brief` row pointing at the stub `template_id`) can *succeed* even though a `select` of that same default returns nothing. If writes work but reads come back empty, suspect RLS scoping before suspecting missing rows.

**Pattern — provision per-user at runtime, in the store, on first use:**

1. **Find** the user's own copy of the default data (`select … where user_id = auth.uid()`).
2. **Create** it owned by the current user if none exists, and keep the real DB id it comes back with.
3. **Reconcile**, don't just "insert if empty": insert any canonical items the user is missing *and* update rows whose definition has drifted (renamed label, new order/`position`, changed placeholder). "Insert only when the table is empty" silently strands existing users on the old set the moment you add or reorder a canonical item later.

Define the canonical set **once in code** (e.g. `src/lib/<thing>.js`) as the single source of truth; the DB rows are just per-user instances of it. Cache the resolved per-user id (e.g. the template id) in the store so subsequent creates/saves reference the user's *own* row, never the stub default id.

(Concretely: this surfaced in a case-brief app where the brief's "template sections" were seeded only for a stub user, so every real user saw an empty form. The fix was a `getTemplateSections()` that finds-or-creates the user's template, then reconciles missing/renamed/reordered sections against a code-defined canonical list.)

## State Management (Pinia) Conventions

- One store per domain concept (`useAuthStore`, `useCartStore`) — avoid one giant catch-all store.
- Use the function-based "setup store" syntax, since it mirrors `<script setup>` and keeps state/getters/actions readable as plain `ref`/`computed`/functions:
  ```js
  // stores/cart.js
  import { defineStore } from 'pinia'
  import { ref, computed } from 'vue'

  export const useCartStore = defineStore('cart', () => {
    const items = ref([])
    const total = computed(() => items.value.reduce((sum, i) => sum + i.price, 0))

    function addItem(item) {
      items.value.push(item)
    }

    return { items, total, addItem }
  })
  ```
  (See "Backend & Auth Conventions" above for the actual `useAuthStore` shape — auth has its own dedicated pattern since it wraps Supabase.)
- Components access stores via `const authStore = useAuthStore()` inside `<script setup>`, never by importing state directly.

## Component Conventions

- `<script setup>` first, then `<template>`, then `<style scoped>` — keep this order consistent.
- Component file names: PascalCase (`UserCard.vue`).
- Props: declare with `defineProps` and explicit types, not just a bare array of names, so the AI (and future-you) knows the expected shape at a glance:
  ```js
  defineProps({
    user: { type: Object, required: true }
  })
  ```
- Prefer small, single-purpose components over large ones with many responsibilities — if a component file is doing more than one clear job, that's a signal to split it.

## Styling Gotchas

- **Native `<button>` text/border color doesn't inherit from `body`, and can vanish under OS dark mode.** Browsers' UA stylesheet gives `<button>` a default `color: buttontext` (a system color keyword) — this does *not* inherit the page's `color`, even if you set one on `body`. `buttontext`/`buttonface` resolve differently depending on whether the OS/browser is in light or dark mode. If a button rule sets a custom `background` (e.g. white) but never sets an explicit `color`, the text is invisible (white-on-white) for any user whose system is in dark mode — while buttons that *do* set `color` explicitly (active/toggle states, etc.) render fine, making the bug easy to miss in your own light-mode dev environment.
  - **Fix, two parts:**
    1. Add `color-scheme: light` to the global `body` rule (next to wherever `color`/`background` are set) for any app that's light-mode-only (no dark theme variant) — this opts the page out of the browser's automatic system-color swapping entirely.
    2. Still explicitly set `color: var(--color-text)` (or whatever the theme's text variable is) on every custom button rule, rather than relying on inheritance — don't assume a button's text color "just works" because the surrounding text does. Treat `color-scheme: light` as the belt, explicit `color` per button as the suspenders.
  - This isn't limited to `<button>` — `<select>`, `<input>`, and other form controls have the same system-color-keyword defaults, so apply the same explicit-`color` discipline to those too.

## What to do when something isn't covered here

If a project needs something this skill doesn't specify yet (a backend choice, a UI library, a deployment target), don't silently invent a default and bury it in code — say so explicitly, suggest a sensible option, and ask whether to add it to this skill so future projects inherit the same answer.
